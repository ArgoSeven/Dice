## Distinguishing Between Normal and Loaded Dice
**In this mod, players can encounter both normal and "loaded" dice**. The key difference lies in their appearance before being rolled for the first time. A loaded dice will display a 6 on its top face, indicating that it is rigged to favor higher rolls. In contrast, a standard dice will show a 1 on its top face. This visual cue allows players to easily identify the type of die before trading with villagers or gathering from chests. After the first roll, the dice become **visually indistinguishable**.
